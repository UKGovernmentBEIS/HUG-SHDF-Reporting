      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Lodgements that have been made in TrustMark over the past month by your installers will be added to this platform.
      </p>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The platform uses TrustMark's Application Programming Interface (API) to gather the lodgement data efficiently and securely.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        New lodgements will be listed on the relevant property in your register.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You will then need to update the properties' statuses to 'Complete' if there are no further measures to be installed at the property.
      </p>
